# Ambitus Port Project Proposal Process

Based on the [CNCF Project Proposal Process v1.1](https://github.com/CNCF/toc/blob/40abe6f81c2b46842a87d6c47cf4190f0d8c1856/process/project_proposals.adoc)

## Introduction

This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for projects to be accepted into the Ambitus project. The process is the same for both existing projects which seek to move into the OMP, and new projects to be formed within the Open Mainframe Project.

## Project Proposal Requirements

Projects must be proposed to the Ambitus TSC and provide the following information to the best of your ability:

* Name of project
* Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)
* State of mainframe support in the project.
* Sponsor from TSC (sponsor helps mentor projects)
* License and contribution guidelines (refer to the [OMP guidelines](contribution_guidelines.md))
* Source control (GitHub by default)
* External dependencies (including licenses)
* Initial committers (how long working on project)
* Infrastructure requests (CI / OMP Cluster)
* Communication channels (slack, irc, mailing lists)
* Issue tracker (GitHub by default)
* Community size and any existing sponsorship

## Project Acceptance Process

* Projects are required to present their proposal at an Ambitus TSC meeting
* Projects get accepted via a 2/3 supermajority vote of the Ambitus TSC
* All projects start at the Incubation stage by default unless the Ambitus TSC approves otherwise.
