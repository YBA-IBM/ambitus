# Ambitus
The Ambitus project helps anyone who wants to understand how open source
software works on the IBM Z platform.  The content provided by members of this
community should be of use to developers, Linux system administrators, and
traditional z/OS system programmers.

This project has two major branches:
- [How-to and example information](./how_to.md) showing how code from other platforms can be
  developed, deployed and managed on IBM Z.
- A home for [projects being ported to IBM Z](./ported_projects.md).  These ports are downstream from the
  original project, and upstream from the IBM Z platform.  Developers can
	make their efforts more visible to others as they work, and share their experiences
	more easily.  The goal is for teams to upstream their changes over time to the
	original project, enhancing the adoption of IBM Z as a supported platform.

If you're new to the platform, you may first want to review
some [things to know about IBM Z](./things_to_know.md).  This can be especially useful
for developers.

Whether you are a user who wants to know more about IBM Z, or you have a project
to bring to the platform, we hope you find a home in the Ambitus community.
